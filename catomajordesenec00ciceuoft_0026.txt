chief for which natural excitability paved the way. When,
for example, Cicero demands in reference to Milo “whom

money about this time. “Is Dolabella going to pay‘3”
he asks anxiously of Dolabella's friends z this is the way
in which he asks Dolabella himself. Equally amusing in·
stances of his unscrupulous finesse and exaggeration might
be collected from other letters: when Atticus, for example,
writes to remonstrate with him for leaving his province
in the charge of a mere boy, a certain Caelius, Cicero
writes back, “Great heavens! how 1 have made Oaelius
love you Ξ Ι have read him letters from you, written not
by you but by your seoretary.''⁴⁷ A proof, however, that
this vicious habit of mind had become a second nature
to him, and that he was not as guilty as appearances
suggest of conscious artifice, is supplied hythe fact that
he wrote an extravagant panegyric on Milo, to Caesar of
all persons in the world τ he could hardly have hoped to
deceive him : Caesar sent a laughing reply.⁴⁸

Of his egotism, vanity and jealousy it woul'd not be dif-

“ Notes on Catullus'' seems to attribute his hostility to
Caesar mainly to this unworthy motive: he felt that Caesar
