Futurum est. This periphrasis for orit represents the event
as on the very verge oi fulfilment.

Nisi molestum est· A courteous expression like our ‘⁴ Η you
please.”

Tamquam lonyam aliquam viam, Notice the terminatione,
representing perhaps the tediousness of a long journey.

Quam ingrediendum sit· N otice the peculiar construction,
inyrediendwm sit governing quam. It seems like an imitation
of the Greek construction with the verbal in—z'eor. It is a rare
archaism in Latin prose. Perhaps Cicero here affects the archaic
style to suit Cato's manner of speaking. In common Latin it
would be quae nobis inqrediemla.

Istuc· Neut. acc. of pronoun istic, istaec, istoc or istuc,
emphatic form of what is called the demonstrative of the second
person.

We have in the last sentence of this chapter and in the next
chapter a close imitation of a passage in the introduction to
Plato's ‘⁴ Republic,’' where Socrates is eonversing with the aged
Cephalus.

ΠΙ.

7, Pares oum paribus facilli-ne congregantur. The
proverb is as old as Homer : ὦς αἰεὶ τὸν ὁμοῖον ἄγει Θεός ὡς τὸν ὁμοῖον,
Od. 17, 218. We find it also in Plato: ὁ παλαιὸς λόγος εὖ ἔχει, ὡς
ὁμοῖον ὁμοίῳ ἀεὶ πελάζει, Symp. G. 18, 3; and in many other Greek
writers. We have it in English in ‘⁴ Birds of a feather flock to-
gether'' and “Like will to like.” Compare Eeotus. 13, 15,
“Every beast loveth his kind and every man loveth his neigh-
bour: all flesh consorteth according to kind and a man will cleave
to his like.'’ Facillime .· ‘ most cheerfully.'

auae-cognate acc. with deplorare, referring to querelis by

synesis. Some MSS. have quas.
'rum- · · ·tum—‘ both. . . .and.'

carerent—subi„ because they express merely their own senti·
ments.
