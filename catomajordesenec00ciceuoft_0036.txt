book in this light is evident not only from the date of its
composition, but from the tone in which he speaks of it
in his letters. “ I must read my ‘ Cato Major’ oftener:
old age sours me: I take offence at everything,''⁶¹ and
again, “I ani glad my Cato does you g‹›od.’'⁶‘⁸ Even to
Cicero—lightly though he took philosophy—his treatise
was more a sermon than an essay. But more than this ε
to a Roman whose natioual literature was still young—at
any rate so far as philosophy was concerned—the work
would not seem hackneyed. We may conclude this re-
view of “De Senectute'’ by quoting—again from Words-
worthn-some stanzas parallel in spirit though far more
exquisite in expression to a passage63 of this book ς
My eyes are dim with childish tears,
My heart is idly stirred,

’ For the same souud is in my ears
Which in those days Ι heard.

Thus fares it still in our decay: ’
And yet the wiser mind

Mourus less for what ege takes away
Thau what it leaves behind.

The blackbird in the summer trees,
The lark upon the hill,

Le: loose their carols when they please,
Are quiet when they will.

With nature never do they wage
A foolish strife: they see

A happy youth, and their old age
Is beautiful and free.
