‘1'1113 LANGUAGE 01³· m CATO·

It has been assumed by many that Cicero in the “De Senec-
πάθ’ affected the antique style of Cato. This notion must be
dispelled. We have it is true some horridiora verba ln the treat-
ise, but on the whole the Latin is Cieeronian, and the style is as
far removed from that of De re rustica as it well could be. The
alleged archaisms are (1) the passive use of deponent participles,
as adeptam, dimensa, meditatum, in sections 4, 59, 74 ; (2) the
use of the nom. of the gerund governing an acc. in sect. 6,-
quam ingrediendum sit ; 3) the occurrence of neutiquam in sec.
425 (4) the occurrence of quasi for quemadmodum in sect. 713 (5)
the use of audaciter for audacter in sect. 72; (6) and of tuerentur
for intuerentur in sect. 77.
