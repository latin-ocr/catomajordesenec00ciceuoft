Cicero addresses his friend Titus Pomporlus Atticus. He
quotes from the Annales of Ennius some verses addressed to
Titus Quinctius Flamininus, who conquex-ed 1-11ilip of Macedon
at Cynoscephalae, 197 Rc. The commentator· begin to fight at
the very first sentence of this treatise.

who addr‹·sses Flamininus ¹? There are at least three opinions:

(1) Ennius himself utters these verses, the distress mentioned
having been caused by the wicked conduct oi the brother of
Flamininus, expelled in consequence from the senate by Cato.

(2) Paetus, the colleague of Flamininus in the consulship,
speaks, on the occasion of the ominous prodigies which were
preventing Flamininus from departing for Macedonia.

(3) The words are uttered by the herdsman who guided Flam-
ininus through the mountain pasees oi Epirus after he had been

’ baffled fo'r iorty days in his en ‹leavors to proceed.
