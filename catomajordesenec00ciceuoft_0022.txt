myself, nox, lon: enough for the state.’ '' This is amusing
but, as Seneca says, scurrilous: it contains half the truth:
the other side oi the picture may partially be seen in the
graceful words of Livy, “ of all his adversities, his exile,
the overthrow of his party, the loss of his daughter and
the rest, he faced none as a man should, except death.
Yet if one will weigh his virtues with his faults, he will
be found to have been a great man, vigorous‚ memorable 3
and he who would adequately rehearse Cicero's praises
noeds Gieero's eloquence.’' It is unfortunate that Cicero
himself should have acted on this principle. Or again if
the evidence of the two Caesars—-of the genereus and
great Julius and the cold but perhaps greater Augustus
be examined, it will not be unfavorable. “ A great man,
my child,'’ said Augustus to the boy whom he discovered
reading the forbidden author “and one who loved his

count1·y.” Still less did Julius entertain for Cicero that κ

contempt, on the strength of which his admiring bio-
grapher brands him with praise. Julius was a great
statesman and a great student of literature, before he was
a soldier: as a soldier he would despise the man who “was
born for nothing less than for the camp,’'³⁵ but as a states-
man he knew the value of the support of a moderate man
like Cicer0, whose name was a power among the respectable
classes in Italy, and whose honesty aud patriotism being
undoubted offered a marked contrast to the mere ruffians
and libertines who supported himself. Nor would
Cicero's philosophical and other writings seem contempt-
ible to Caesar because they were inferior to the great

 

u· Livy.
