Nemes. - 147

’1.’01Ι artos tantae scientiae—⁸ so many ambs requiring so ex-
tensive knowledgeJ Some editors regard θείω-ὑέων ae a plura&
The plural form is very rare. Perhaps the proximity of the
plurale artes and inventa had some influence.

Quumque semrm, etc. Copied from Plato's ss‘naedrus.

Nec Pl‘hfflflpissm- etc.—‘nor has it an externa] source of
motion) Compare Plato’s ἀρχὴ κινήσεως.

Quum simplex animi. etc. Again from the Phaedo of
Plato. In Butler’s Analogy we have the same argumetum—that
as death must be looked upon as the resolution of a compound
body into ite parts, therefore the soul, which is not eompounded,
cannot die.

Observe the imperfecte esset and haberet, influeneed by the
aorist persuasi·

Quod Si non possit· Quod may be the subject of possit,
(fieri understood) or it may be a conj. (bu-t) with animus as the
eubJect of possit, (dividi understood).

Homines scire, etc. From the Phaedo.

. Reminisci et recordari-‘to call to mind aud to dwell on
the recollection!

Wordsworth into his sweet Ode on the Intimatione of Im-
mortality has introduced Plato‘s doctrine of ἁναμνῆσις;

“Our birth is but ,a sleep and a forgettinx ε
'the soul that rises with us, our life’s star,
nath had elsewhere its setting,
And cometh from afar:
Not in entire forgetfulness,
And not in utter nasscedness,
But trailing clouds of glory do we come
From God who is our home.”

Haeo Platonh fere. A variant here is haec Plato noste-r
