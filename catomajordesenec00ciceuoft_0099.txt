Evocated the passing of the Voconian Law.'

“ The Voconian Law, passed during the later republic, 169
ss.c.‚ imposed a restriction on the institution of women as heirs.
It applied only to large estates. A person whom the census
placed in the first class, as having a rated property of at least
1003000 asses, was forbidden to appoint a woman as his heir.
The alleged design os the statute is said to have been to restrain
the growing luxury and extravagance of women by withholding
strom them the means of being luxurious and extravagant on a
large scale. A stronger reason must have been the ‹is-sire of the
wealthy class to keep large estates in the agnate families to which
they belonged. 11 such an estate became the inheritance of a
woman, it was apt to pass by marriage into another family.'’-
(Hadley.) Further, by this law no person or persons, male or
female, could by will receive legacies amounting in all to a larger
sum than that received by the principal heir or heirs.
