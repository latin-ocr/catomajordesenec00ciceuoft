144 . sorus.

Sed· · · quantus. Supply dixerit,
Nemo, etc. The distich complete as given in the Tusculum ⁶
Disputations is:
Nemo me lacrumis decoret neque funera fletu
Fuit. Gur? volito vivos per ora virum.

[Vivos τ vivus : virum, gen. plur.]
The metre of the couplet is the elegiae metre, as in the Greek

⁴ and Latin distichs above.

Lam-umis. Enmus may have written this, but in classieal
Latin, lacrima is the only correct form, not lam-uma, lachrima,
nor bacho-yma.

Fletu· In prose, cum fletu.

Faxit. Archaic form of jecerit. The subject is the affirma-
tive quisquam understood from nemo.

consequatur· Subj. in indirect discourse.

74, Jam sensus, etc.—‘ further, there may be some conscious-
nese of the process os dying, but that only for a moment,
especially in tne case of an old 'man ' ; ie, thore may be a pain-
ful sensation in the crisis, but it is very brief. Notice the

adversative force of que.
Post mortem quidem sensus aut optandus aut nullus

ent—³ after death indeed there is either a desirable consciousness
or none.' This is one of the most important statements in the
Ciceronian philosophy.

secl hoc meditatum. ete—‘but this lesson must be dwelt
upon from our youth up.⁹ Observe the passive use of meditatum.
The deponent participles used as passivos in this treatiee are
among the alleged archaisms. We have already had adeptam
(sect. 4), dimensa (59). Π these be archaisms, Cicero’s style is
always are-haic.

Mortem m, etc.——Observe the emphatic position of mortem.

Et id incertum, etc.—‘and, possibly, this very day.’ Incor-
twm an belongs to the same category as haud ocio an and nescio
an, all leaning towards the notion that the thing is so.
Ι 'rimem- The participial phrase, as often, is here conditional.
