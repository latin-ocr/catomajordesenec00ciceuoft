suddenly collapsed. Deceived by the uncertain attitude of
Pompeius, who never knew his own mind and was in con-
sequence eminently successful in misgui‘ling his adherents,
Cicero ventured in' March to threaten2⁰ Caesar. Pompeius
immediately veered round, came to terms with Caesar, and
complained to Quintus Cicero that his brother had broketi
his pledge of good behaviour. There was nothing for it
but 1·ccantati0n,²¹ and Marcus swallowed the “nasty mouth-
fu1‚”²² “collected himself and bade farewell to all right,
true, and honest counsels.’'²³ ‘⁴1 have been,’' he writes,
‘⁴ a very ass,” or as he characteristically phrases it in an-
other letter intended for the public ear, “I asked my
country to permit me to be honest and keep my brother’s
pledges z Ι had proved myself a good citizen, I wished also
to be a good man.'' ²⁶¹

It is unnecessary to follow Cicero further into the bye-
ways and slums of Roman politica. No one will under-
stand the history of the period, who is not, if not a cynic,
at least capable of appreciating the cynic standpoint ; the
part which Cicero played was not more edifying than that
of others, and was confined mainly to sealing his recanta-
tion by successive specches in defence of his former
enemies-Balbus, GalluS‚ Crassus, Messius, Vatinius,
Gabinius—aud veiling the ignominy of his position, wher-
ever this was possible, and by pitiful evasions.²⁶
