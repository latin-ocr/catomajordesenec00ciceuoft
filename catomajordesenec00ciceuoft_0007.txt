No work more suitable than “Cato Major-’⁹ could have
ι been selected by the University authozities as the prose
, 181111 of J 1111101· Matriculation. Cicero’s political philosophy
,, find speculative philosophy are diffieu1t; but in his moral
-treatises,-especially in the little essays on Old Age and
,ἷῖ’ΞῊοοᾱ5ὴ1Ρ,-015 style is· very simple. Sometimes names are
7 ³<bugbears‚ and the 1181110 “philosophy” has frightened away
ᾗ ζ’111811γ 8 student from some of the richest treats in all
»literature
The main topic of the so· -ealled Dialogue on Old Age is
{speculiarly attractive, even to the youthful student. As he
is led on, step by step, through the artless arguments—
⁷ 'arguments not of the head, but of the beart—he becomes
’· ''moro and more attached to the old man who speaks through
' *he lips of Cato. The last Chapters, containing Cicero's
' fsviews regarding the immortality of the soul‚ are most en-
011811ῦί118. Α5 the pagan philosopher reaches the last round
-of his climax, and grapples with the grandest problem that
-0811 engage the attention of man,—as he “stretches out his
,181110 hands of faith'’ and almost grasps the truths of Reve-
‚j ’λήθην-85 1115 airy vision fills him with momentary rapture,
⁷ jae—the earnest student is carried away with him into regions
Α ξαι- above the petty concerns and the mechanic philosophies
'g ἑοῖ this “working-day world.’'
’ ‘It is necessary to notice some of the special features of the
μ ¹gffesent edition of the “ Cato.” The desire of the editor to
'¹' ’ξ’ 1 e the vwork as valuable as possible has led him to depart
ἰ ξι several respecta from the beaten path.
