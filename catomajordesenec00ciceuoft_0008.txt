Tho Examination Papers—the contributions of twenty· -four
masters—supply data. for forming an aeeurate estimato of tho
collective opinion of the Classical Masters of the Provinoe ,
regarding the proper scope-and character of a matriculation ³ ἰ
paper in Latin. The editor takes this opportunity to thank ,
his friends for their genereus aid in the aeeomplishment οἱ — ,
his design.

An old text has been reproduced in this edition for various
reasons, The publio examiners still see fit to set before ean·
didates selections from the old texts .0f classical authors.
Many of our elassieal masters hesitate to discard the ortho- -
graphy of Latin words with which they.be0ame familiar in TU.
their boyhood. Canadian classical editors have hitherto Α
elung to the old forms. Examiners and masters and editors
all admit that the scienee of philology has advaneed with
long strides during the last twenty years. Every one knows ” x
that coelum, coena, caeteri, are bnseless fictions ; yet the anti· - ,Ῐῗ
quated forms are still in vogue. In the notes of this edition ’ ’.κ
the attention of the student has been called to many timo-
honored blunders.

[n the matter of etymology, too, we nave stagnated long ,Ι
enough. In the present editor’ s edition of Virgil’ s AEneid, ’
Book V.. it was thought expedient to give many of the old&- ἶ
deriv ations. In this edition of‘ ‘,”Cato the obsolete assump· ² -
tions of the old grammar-iaus have been entirely abandoned,
and the more rational explanations of modern philologiam ,ι
have been adopted. Harper’s Latin Dietionary (Andrewoeft ,,
Freund) has been followed in almost every ease. This lexicon θ ῗ
will probably within ten years be the standard authority on ” .
Latin orthography and etymology wherever the English lana· 1³
guage is spoken. ’-

In the notes, the editor has collated from many conten ,
. merything that would tend to elucidata the text. Hi· ob· , ·
ligations to the different authoritie- consultati have beon j
aeknowledged throughout the notes. ’
