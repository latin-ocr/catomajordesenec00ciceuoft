mctawrom· Cicero mentions only one dictatorship. Oin-
cinnetus was dictator twice. The reference in this passage iu
probably to the second occasion.

Fatum· The technical term was dictatorem dicere. The
senate elected a. person and he was nominat-,ed (dietus in the
dead of night by one of the consuls.

Cujus dicta oris. Cujus is not an adJeotive: dictatoris is in

⁴ apposition with cujus.

Ahala· · · ·interomit-‘A. anticipated M. in his designa and
put him to death because he was aspiring to regal power! Ap-
petentemaquia appetebat.

Arcessebantur. Some editions have arcessebatur. The im- ”

nerfeot tense expresses what was a custom in the old days.
Viatores were servantz who executed the orders of c rtain

Roman magistrates to whom they bore the same relation as the

lictors ‘nore to other magistrates. They received the name on-

account of their being employed on 111essageS,-—to summon the ,

senators to the curia, to summon the people to the comitia, etc.

Horum· A variant is eorum.

Haud seio an. As this phrase is almost equal to fortasse,
we should expect nulla not ulla. Indeed, many editions read
nulla.

Officio—⁸ in point of duty.’

Saturnum 0⁰}'iffllue· Anthon's note on this phrase betrays
his fondness for hendiadys. It should be remembered that. this
figure is almost entirely poetical. The expression before us is
perhaps tautological. One editor says, however, that saturitate
is subjective, aud copia objective; by which he probably means
that the farmer has boundless resource in reserve, as well ae
the supply os the hour.

Ut··· walamnum—‘so that we may now be reconciled with ’
pleesure, since certain persons desire such things as these) Qm‘·
dcun—the authors of the third charge against old age. Compare
the expression in sect. 46, ne omnino bellum badenim videar .
voluptati. '
