Greek models z there is no reason to doubt the sincerity
of his admiration for Cicero's knowledge as well as for his
literary style ς there is no reason to question the
heartiness of the generous words²⁵⁶ written from Gaul and
the midst of the conquered foe.

Putting the judgment of the Caesars aside, the features
in Cicero’s character which appeal most strongly to Chris-
tian sympathies are three in number : (1 ) his humanity;
(2) his domestic affections3 (3) his intellectual industry.

1. Cicero, like Virgil and Plutarch, was a Christian
Pagan. At a time when the blood of gladiators and of
wild beasts was poured out like water to gratify the
“leeches of the Forum ²²„- contionalis hirudo-'W—Oicero
cared for none of these things& the sight of butchered
elephants only siekened him. Like the Athenians whom
he loved he worshipped at the altar of Pity. The same
humanity led ‚him—in spite of his anxiety to keep the
equites in good temper-to mitigate the oppression of the
tax—sarmers of Cilicia3 the same humanity made him a
gentle master to his slaves: the only slave, it has been
remarked‚3⁹ against whom he expresses resentment, is—
significantly enough—one who stole some books 2 he
sends⁴⁰ kind messages to Atticus’ servants and shows the
greatest interest in the health of his freedman Tiro, whom
he entreats to remain perfectly quiet, till the services of a
special cook, whom he has ordered to attend the invalid,
shall have restored his strength.
